| **_Organizational Traits to AVOID_** |     |
| Concepts: | Complacency, Sense of Entitlement, Apathy |
| Concepts: | 4 Levels of Value<br><br>* Level 1: Product<br>* Level 2: Service<br>* Level 3: Business Results<br>* Level 4: Strategic Partner |
| Note: | Level 1: (Product)<br><br>* Transactional<br>* Product or Service<br>* Vendor |
| Note: | Level 2: (Service)<br><br>* Experience<br>* Support or Service<br>* Supplier<br>* Client concerns<br>	* Are you easy to do business with?<br>	* Can you align what you do with the needs of the people who are going to interact with you and your business on a regular basis?<br>	* Can you quickly and effectively solve the problems that come with buying and using your product? |
|     | Level 3: (Business Results)<br><br>* ROI<br>* Tangible Business Outcomes<br>* Preferred Vendor<br>* Client concerns<br>	* You sell the business improvement that your product or service produces for your client. You sell outcomes! |
|     | Level 4: (Strategic Partner)<br><br>* Strategic <br>* Proactive<br>* Trusted Advisor<br>* Client concerns<br>	* Level 4 means that you have the business acumen and situational knowledge (in other words, the experience) that allow you to create a strategic level of value. It means you understand and can explain the dissonance your dream client is experiencing; you can explain why they are struggling to produce the results they need and are challenged by their current circumstances. You can explain to the client why and how they need to change before they need to make that change. This is the “advice” part of “trusted adviser.” |
