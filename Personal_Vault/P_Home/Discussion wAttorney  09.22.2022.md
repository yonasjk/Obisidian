My desire is to have 'sole custody' physical and legal custody of my child. My _realistic_ desire is to have a '%50/%50' split with my ex-wife in everything. I am genuinely concerned for my child's future so I will need time to raise him! I understand that it will be cumbersome.<br><br>**_My suggested arrangement options:_**<br><br>* Temporary Arrangement 1<br>	* Goal: %50 time with both parents; 3 months / 3 months<br>	* Other parent gets (1st and 3rd weekends) visitation<br>		* provide own travel expenses<br>	* Current: Since my child has been with ex-wife for an entire year; I want equal time!<br>		* Wishful: I get him the rest of 2022 in contrast to ex-wife having him since Oct 2021.<br>* Temporary Arrangement 2<br>	* %60 - %40 split of time with parents; 8 months / 4 months<br>		* 3 Summer months (June, July, & August) & 1 Holiday month (December)<br>		* Other parent gets (1st and 3rd weekends) visitation<br>			* provide own travel expenses<br>	* \*Every 3 years the roles of parents alternates ... This is the primary assurance that I get a chance to educate/raise my son.  We have very different views on parenting. It is difficult (unlikely) but should at least consider.<br><br>I am willing to show any flexibility needed for this temporary visitation arrangement. But my understanding is that these temporary arrangements can shift into the actual custody arrangements ... and that could be concerning. If this is the case, then I want to push for my equal access starting now.<br><br>**_Concern: Living arrangement_**<br><br>* An actual living space must be provided ...... for any custody arrangement to be considered<br>	* my child must be provided a living space (home/apartment)<br>		* I am providing my child a home -- ex-wife is not!<br>* 8+ people in a single 3-bedroom home -- not a healthy living environment; no privacy, no peace<br>* No space for growth, development, or proper parenting<br><br>**_Concern: Development delays_**<br><br>* Pediatrician noted development delays; and I am seeing it in him<br>* No English is being communicated is confusing his language development<br>* Concern this delay is from living arrangement and lack of socialization<br>	* Minimal interaction with anyone outside of family; very concerning<br><br>**_Concern: Health endangerment_**<br><br>* She lied about contracting Covid-19, hid it completely from me!<br>	* Through an external source, I discovered that several family members contracted Covid-19 and passed onto my child<br>* She changed medical providers (pediatrician, etc.) _unilaterally_, no input - no discussion<br><br>**_Concern: Mental health denial_**<br><br>* The mental health of my ex-wife is concerning.  _This needs to be addressed and made public._<br>	* It became immediately apparent after the wedding, that the family was hiding this.<br>* There are serious past traumas that are unresolved and not addressed. Immediately it became apparent that whomever has raped/molested my ex-wife is being protected by her family. I am concerned that this person is known to the family and may be around my child. _I would like this to be made public._<br><br>Understanding that some of these items can be considered 'mudslinging'  but I am not sure how to properly introduce them. Or when? But all of these are genuine concerns! I suspect they are not necessary for this hearing but I would like to discuss these further as concerns.<br><br>**_Custody Arrangement requirements:_**<br><br>* Child must be provided a living space (home/apartment).<br>	* Co-habitation with family inadequate<br>	* NayEl must have his own room!<br>* Child must have childcare (w/professional org or daycare) -- no family babysitting<br>* Child must be provided education/socialization<br>	* Must be in top 3 educational programs of area (private or public)<br>	* Must be provided supplementary education (Kumon, Montessori)<br>* Communication must be captured via 3rd party platform<br><br>\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* |
