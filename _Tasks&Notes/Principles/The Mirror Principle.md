1. The Mirror you reflects your attitude towards it
	1. Thought + Feeling = Attitude
2. The Mirror reflects the content of your attitude, not context
	1. The more I hate that thing, the more that keeps happening.
3. The Mirror of Reality operates with delay
	1. The time delay is dependent on the complexity of the goal
4. The Reflection is shaped in the Unity of Heart and Mind
	1. Intention :: inner vs outer intentions
		1. Outer Intention is the realm of the heart
		2. Inner Intention is the realm of the mind
	2. The reflection that you're presenting. The clarity of that reflection is dependent on how united your heart and mind are, how united your thought and feeling are.

Image Mastery
	- You must focus on What You Want and What You Have
	ex. Write down 3 things that you are grateful for (every morning)
		- I'm alive and healthy
		- I have a beautiful son
		- I have unlimited potential
	- The more you focus on the things that you are GRATEFUL for, the more of it you'll get	
	- SHIFT your attention away from what you DON'T KNOW and what you DON'T HAVE
		- Act on what you know! Knock on one door, and keep going...
	- The CRUCIAL part to mastering the IMAGE is my ATTITUDE, the attitude that I'm presenting to this mirror of reality.
	- Setback are a Blessing in Disguise. Keep you ATTITUDE intact.

**********************************************************************
Intention Mastery
	- There are different LIFELINES.
		- OUTER INTENTION is the shift between parallel lifelines. Switching train tracks
		- INNER INTENTION is movement along the lifeline. Taking of action
	- Aling your thoughts (ATTITUDE), your WORDS, and your ACTIONS

**********************************************************************
The Key is Consistent Application
	- Most fail because they don't keep a consistent image
