Attention vs Intention

Whatever you focus your Attention makes a potential reality manifest (becomes a lifeline)
- Possibilities are created by your attention
- Wherever your Attention goes your Reality goes

Intention is what causes movement in that lifeline
- Most people focus on what they don't want, or don't have
- When things happen in life that you don't have, it's because your focusing on things you don't want!

Focus -- Change the focus of the conversation from what you don't have to what you have!
	- GRATEFULNESS!!!! You can't feel fear when you have gratitude
	- How can I do it?
	- Focus on what you DO have and what you DO want
		- We unlock that sector of reality

Total Energy = Frequency x Intensity of the thought
	- Your feelings of LOVE must be stronger than Hatred (Fear)
	- Feel intensely, intensely, intensely GRATEFUL !!!!
		- Train for this! .... Re-direct your thoughts
		- Re-direct from what you DON'T have to what you DO have. .... Optimism!
			- Recognize that trigger!

Your thoughts have a unique vibration, learn to re-direct that you want

*My life is my responsibility*!

---
Intention is our Resolve to Have and to Act!
- This is how move along the lifeline...
- Do not let doubts creep in! Trained to be fearful, ungrateful, and glass is half-empty

Intention is moving towards (along lifeline) or moving away from intents

If you have been experiencing the life you don't want, its because you have been vibrationally creating it! You are emitting the vibration

Key = Have Congruence with Attention
	- Which version of me is showing up? Needy, Desperate ... or Grateful, it's part of the journey
	- Begin with WHO .... and then act!

"I am becoming the person I want to be!"
"I am making progress, everything is going well!"
" I am becoming better!"
